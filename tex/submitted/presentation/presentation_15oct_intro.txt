Title
Fine-tuned optical character recognition for dental fossil markings

Thesis background
Digitizing and uniformizing the structure of handwritten fossil catalogues exhibits a great potential for increasing the accuracy of paleontological data analysis by increasing sample sizes. Approximately 90, 000 of such samples reside in the archives of the National Museum of Kenya, and an ongoing effort is to store this data in a digital format for better accessibility. A previous project utilized a commercial optical character recognition service for automated reading of these catalogues. This generalist handwriting detection model lacked the ability to detect special characters used to denote tooth samples, leading to loss of information and detection mistakes. This thesis aims to build a specialist character recognition model to increase the accuracy of the tooth type specifying column of the digitized data by fine-tuning an image-classifying deep neural network.

Presentation content
The presentation will be giving a rough outline on how the detection of dental markings could be implemented. Additionally, a high-level optical character recognition pipeline for constructing tabular, cleaned data from scanned catalogue PDF files will be presented. The work is in progress, so only preliminary results will be available.
