    abstract="NOW (New and Old Worlds) is a global database of fossil mammal occurrences, currently containing around 68,000 locality-species entries. The database spans the last 66 million years, with its primary focus on the last 23 million years. Whereas the database contains recordsNOW Databaserecords from all continents, the main focus and coverage of the database historically has been on Eurasia. The database includes primarily, but not exclusively, terrestrial mammals. It covers a large part of the currently known mammalian fossil record, focusing on classical and actively researched fossil localities. The database is managed in collaboration with an international advisory board of experts. Rather than a static archive, it emphasizes the continuous integration of new knowledge of the communityNOW Databasedatacuration in, data curationDatacuration, and consistencyNOW Databaseconsistency of scientific interpretations. The database records species occurrences at localities worldwide, as well as ecologicalEcological characteristics of fossil species, geological contextsGeologic/geologicalcontext of localities and more. The NOW database is primarily used for two purposes: (1) queries about occurrences of particular taxa, their characteristics and properties of localities in the spirit of an encyclopedia; and (2) large scale research and quantitative analyses of evolutionary processes, patterns, reconstructing past environments, as well as interpreting evolutionary contexts. The data are fully open, no logging in or community membership is necessary for using the data for any purpose.",

    abstract = {Few-shot learning (FSL) has emerged as an effective learning method and shows great potential. Despite the recent creative works in tackling FSL tasks, learning valid information rapidly from just a few or even zero samples remains a serious challenge. In this context, we extensively investigated 200+ FSL papers published in top journals and conferences in the past three years, aiming to present a timely and comprehensive overview of the most recent advances in FSL with a fresh perspective and to provide an impartial comparison of the strengths and weaknesses of existing work. To avoid conceptual confusion, we first elaborate and contrast a set of relevant concepts including few-shot learning, transfer learning, and meta-learning. Then, we inventively extract prior knowledge related to few-shot learning in the form of a pyramid, which summarizes and classifies previous work in detail from the perspective of challenges. Furthermore, to enrich this survey, we present in-depth analysis and insightful discussions of recent advances in each subsection. What is more, taking computer vision as an example, we highlight the important application of FSL, covering various research hotspots. Finally, we conclude the survey with unique insights into technology trends and potential future research opportunities to guide FSL follow-up research.},

    abstract = {Optical character recognition (OCR) engines work poorly on texts published with premodern printing technologies. Engaging the key technological contributors from the IMPACT project, an earlier project attempting to solve the OCR problem for early modern and modern texts, the Early Modern OCR Project (eMOP) of Texas A8M received funding from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation to improve OCR outputs for early modern texts from the Eighteenth Century Collections Online (ECCO) and Early English Books Online (EEBO) proprietary database products—or some 45 million pages. Added to print problems are the poor quality of the page images in these collections, which would be too time consuming and expensive to reimage. This article describes eMOP's attempts to OCR 307,000 documents digitized from microfilm to make our cultural heritage available for current and future researchers. We describe the reasoning behind our choices as we undertook the project based on other relevant studies; discoveries we made; the data and the system we developed for processing it; the software, algorithms, training procedures, and tools that we developed; and future directions that should be taken for further work in developing OCR engines for cultural heritage materials.},

    abstract = {Bangla language consists of fifty distinct characters and many compound characters to be named. Several notable studies have been performed to recognize the Bangla characters both as handwritten and optical characters. Our approach is to use transfer learning to classify the basic distinct as well as compound Bangla Handwritten characters avoiding the vanishing gradient problem. Deep Neural Network techniques such as 3D Convolutional Neural Network (3DCNN), Residual Neural Network (ResNet), and MobileNet have been applied to generate an end-to-end classification of all the possible standard formation of the handwritten characters in Bangla language. Bangla Lekha Isolated dataset is used to apply this classification model, which has a total of 1,66,105 Bangla Character images sample data categorized in 84 distinct classes. This classification model achieved 99.82\% accuracy on training data and 99.46\% accuracy on test data. Comparison has been made among the various state-of-the-art benchmarks of Bangla Handwritten Characters classification, which shows that this proposed model got better accuracy in classifying the data.},
