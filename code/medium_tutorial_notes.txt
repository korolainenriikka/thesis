ctc loss
	- width axis needs to be first in tensor (ctc loss assumes time-evolving axis to be first)
	"In order to use the CTC loss, we need to create a CTC layer for use with the model."
	---> nontrivial to use ctc
label = char_to_ind(tf.strings.unicode_split(label,
                                input_encoding = "UTF-8"))
sanity check: plot the loss!!

When using models pre-trained on ImageNet, many articles recommend normalizing the input images using Noramlize(mean=(0.485,0.456,0.406), std=(0.229,0.224,0.225)), which are mean and standard deviation of the ImageNet images.
