Things to test
 
next
- pipeline for using the model on catalogues
- data repo
- classifier chain with 1234
- gpu
- all data out of catalogues
- experiments with techniques used in papers
- more complex regex (parentheses, comma after tooth)

model improvement
- proper data augmentation; do things that make sense 
    - from alexnet: intensity based, random crop, translation
- get more data (test accuracy should be obtainable up to .5% level so preferably at least 200 test samples.)
- hyperparameter optimize (test if parameter transfer applying (ie not changing hyperparams) is a good idea in this case)

extra things to do to improve
- more data
