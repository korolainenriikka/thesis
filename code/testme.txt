Things to test

- data augmentation
- convert images to black and white (rgb values dont mean anything)
- make area either fully white (background) or fully black (foreground)?
    - but: smudged L / R maybe will not show
- evaluation: check for systematic error -> concept drift because of notation style changing over time?


next: baseline: trocr outputs using an annotated tooth record test set

Ways to improve
- also use data from other types of specimen cards

Setup decisions
- annotating: use modifiers not special unicode characters (3+lowerscript modifier instead of lowerscript 3)
