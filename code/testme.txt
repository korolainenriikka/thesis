Things to test
 
- miks malli on dummy

ways to improve
- vgg 16
- gpu (!!!)
- proper data augmentation; do things that make sense 
    - from alexnet: intensity based, random crop, translation
- get more data (test accuracy should be obtainable up to .5% level so preferably at least 200 test samples.)
- hyperparameter optimize (test if parameter transfer applying (ie not changing hyperparams) is a good idea in this case)

extra things to do to improve
- more data
