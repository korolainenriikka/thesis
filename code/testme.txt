Things to test

MIPC model
upper lower model

ways to improve
- better base model. test VGG16 & alexnet (now: loaded & froze the model, prepped data
    - next: read a proper pytorch tutorial (how to do this & implement) https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/transfer_learning_tutorial.html
    (do the ants & bees, do the same with MPI)
- get more data (test accuracy should be obtainable up to .5% level so preferably at least 200 test samples.)
- hyperparameter optimize (test if parameter transfer applying (ie not changing hyperparams) is a good idea in this case)
- try to segment out the letter
- proper data augmentation; do things that make sense 
    - from alexnet: encode prior of intensity invariance by doing intensity based data augmentation

extra things to do to improve
- more data
- balance upper lower perfectly
