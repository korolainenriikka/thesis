Things to test

MIPC model
upper lower model

ways to improve
- better base model. test jamil EMNIST & alexnet
    untuned emnist and largest probability of m i or p?
    reason: our teeth images have lots of redundant signals, mnist does not. imagenet task does so imagenet model could be better
- hyperparameter optimize (test if parameter transfer applying (ie not changing hyperparams) is a good idea in this case)
- try to segment out the letter
